OpenVPN Access Server End User License Agreement (OpenVPN-AS EULA)

    1. Copyright Notice: OpenVPN Access Server License;
       Copyright (c) 2009-2021 OpenVPN Inc. All rights reserved.
       "OpenVPN" is a trademark of OpenVPN Inc.
    2. Redistribution of OpenVPN Access Server binary forms and related documents,
       are permitted provided that redistributions of OpenVPN Access Server binary
       forms and related documents reproduce the above copyright notice as well as
       a complete copy of this EULA.
    3. You agree not to reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify,
       translate, make any attempt to discover the source code of this software,
       or create derivative works from this software.
    4. The OpenVPN Access Server is bundled with other open source software
       components, some of which fall under different licenses. By using OpenVPN
       or any of the bundled components, you agree to be bound by the conditions
       of the license for each respective component. For more information, you can
       find our complete EULA (End-User License Agreement) on our website
       (http://openvpn.net), and a copy of the EULA is also distributed with the
       Access Server in the file /usr/local/openvpn_as/license.txt.
    5. This software is provided "as is" and any expressed or implied warranties,
       including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability
       and fitness for a particular purpose are disclaimed. In no event shall
       OpenVPN Inc. be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental,
       special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited
       to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or
       profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of
       liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including
       negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of this
       software, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.
    6. OpenVPN Inc. is the sole distributor of OpenVPN Access Server
       licenses. This agreement and licenses granted by it may not be assigned,
       sublicensed, or otherwise transferred by licensee without prior written
       consent of OpenVPN Inc. Any licenses violating this provision
       will be subject to revocation and deactivation, and will not be eligible
       for refunds.
    7. Subscription License Key: Entitles you to use this software for the
       duration of term of your subscription up to the concurrent user limit
       specified by your subscription. This license permits you to use the
       software on one or more servers, provided that in no event will the number
       of concurrent VPN connections that all servers may allow exceed the
       concurrent user limit. Upon activation of the first purchased activation
       key for this software, you agree to forego any free licenses or keys that
       were given to you for demonstration purposes, and as such, the free
       licenses will not appear after the activation of a purchased key. You are
       responsible for the timely activation of these licenses on the server or
       servers of your choice.
       Refunds on purchased activation keys are only possible within 30 days of
       purchase of activation key, and then only if the activation key has not
       already been activated on a system. To request a refund, contact us through
       our support ticket system using the account you have used to purchase the
       activation key. Activated subscriptions are nontransferable. Access Server
       Subscription entitles the use of (1) subscription license key on a single
       server or across multiple servers. Once an activated key expires or becomes
       invalid, the concurrency limit on our software product will revert to
       demonstration mode, which allows a maximum of two (2) concurrent users to
       be connected to your server. Prior to your subscription license expiration,
       OpenVPN Inc. will, depending on your purchase selection, either auto-renew
       your subscription, or attempt to remind you to renew your subscription by
       sending periodic email messages to the licensee email address on record.
       You are solely responsible for the timely renewal of your activation key(s)
       prior to their expiration if continued operation is expected after the
       subscription term ends. OpenVPN Inc. will not be responsible for any
       misdirected and/or undeliverable email messages, nor does it have an
       obligation to contact you regarding your subscription term's expiry.
    8. Standard Non-Subscription License Key(s) also called Fixed License Key(s):
       A Purchased Standard Non-Subscription license entitles you to use this
       software for the duration of time denoted on your activation key on any one
       (1) particular device, up to the concurrent user limit specified by your
       license. Multiple activation keys may be activated to achieve a desired
       concurrency limit on this given device. Unless otherwise prearranged with
       OpenVPN Inc., concurrency counts on activation keys are not to be divided
       for use amongst multiple devices. Upon activation of the first purchased
       activation key in this software, you agree to forego any free licenses or
       keys that were given to you for demonstration purposes, and as such, the
       free licenses will not appear after the activation of a purchased key. You
       are responsible for the timely activation of these licenses on your desired
       server of choice. Refunds on purchased activation keys are only possible
       within 30 days of purchase of activation key, and then only if the
       activation key has not already been activated on a system. To request a
       refund, contact us through our support ticket system using the account you
       have used to purchase the activation key.
       Activating a standard Non-Subscription key ties it to the specific
       hardware/software combination that it was activated on, and activated
       activation keys are nontransferable. Substantial software and/or hardware
       changes may invalidate an activated license. In case of substantial
       software and/or hardware changes, caused by for example, but not limited to
       failure and subsequent repair or alterations of (virtualized)
       hardware/software, our software product will automatically attempt to
       contact our online licensing systems to renegotiate the licensing state. On
       any given activation key, you are limited to three (3) automatic
       renegotiations within the activation key lifetime. After these
       renegotiations are exhausted, the activation key is considered invalid, and
       the activation state will be locked to the last valid system configuration
       it was activated on. OpenVPN Inc. reserves the right to grant exceptions to
       this policy for license holders under extenuating circumstances, and such
       exceptions can be requested through a ticket via the OpenVPN Access Server
       ticketing system.
       Once an activated activation key expires or becomes invalid, the
       concurrency limit on our software product will decrease by the number of
       concurrent connections previously granted by the activation key. If all
       purchased activation key(s) have expired, the product will revert to
       demonstration mode, which allows a maximum of two (2) concurrent users to
       be connected to your server. Prior to your license expiration date(s),
       OpenVPN Inc. will attempt to remind you to renew your license(s) by sending
       periodic email messages to the licensee email address on record. You are
       solely responsible for the timely renewal of your activation key(s) prior
       to their expiration if continued operation is expected after the license
       expiration date(s). OpenVPN Inc. will not be responsible for any
       misdirected and/or undeliverable email messages, nor does it have an
       obligation to contact you regarding your expiring activation keys.
    9. Once an activated activation key expires or becomes invalid, the
       concurrency limit on our software product will decrease by the amount of
       concurrent connections previously granted by the activation key. If all of
       your purchased activation key(s) have expired, the product will revert to
       demonstration mode, which allows a maximum of two (2) concurrent users to
       be connected to your server. Prior to your license expiration date(s),
       OpenVPN Inc. will attempt to remind you to renew your license(s) by sending
       periodic email messages to the licensee email address on record. You are
       solely responsible for the timely renewal of your activation key(s) prior
       to their expiration if continued operation is expected after the license
       expiration date(s). OpenVPN Inc. will not be responsible for any
       misdirected and/or undeliverable email messages, nor does it have an
       obligation to contact you regarding your expiring activation keys.
   10. Any valid activation key holder is entitled to use our ticketing system for
       support questions or issues specifically related to the OpenVPN Access
       Server product. To file a ticket, go to our website at https://openvpn.net/
       and sign in using the account that was registered and used to purchase the
       activation key(s). You can then access the support ticket system through
       our website and submit a support ticket. Tickets filed in the ticketing
       system are answered on a best-effort basis. OpenVPN Inc. staff reserve the
       right to limit responses to users of our demo / expired licenses, as well
       as requests that substantively deviate from the OpenVPN Access Server
       product line. Tickets related to the open source version of OpenVPN may
       not be handled here.
   11. Purchasing an activation key does not entitle you to any special rights or
       privileges, except the ones explicitly outlined in this user agreement.
       Unless otherwise arranged prior to your purchase with OpenVPN Inc.,
       software maintenance costs and terms are subject to change after your
       initial purchase without notice. In case of price decreases or special
       promotions, OpenVPN Inc. will not retrospectively apply credits or price
       adjustments toward any licenses that have already been issued. Furthermore,
       no discounts will be given for license maintenance renewals unless this is
       specified in your contract with OpenVPN Inc.

----------------

SQLite is in the Public Domain

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been dedicated to the public
domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the
companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their
contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits
are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to
copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite
code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose,
commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code in SQLite - those
parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger
application. Portions of the documentation and some code used as part of
the build process might fall under other licenses. The details here are
unclear. We do not worry about the licensing of the documentation and build
code so much because none of these things are part of the core deliverable
SQLite library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No
code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every
line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those
authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base
is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

  11. You agree (i) that OpenVPN may identify you as a recipient of services
and use your logo in client lists, sales presentations, marketing materials
and press releases, and (ii) to develop a customer profile for use by OpenVPN
on OpenVPN websites for promotional purposes.

			    NO WARRANTY

  12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2
    as published by the Free Software Foundation.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.
